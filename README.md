# Brain Source Imaging (BSI) Zoo
The goal of this repository is to efficiently implement conventional and state-of-the art brain source imaging techniques and benchmark their performance with respect to different metrics. In the following, we will briefly describe the key information about each method and show preliminary performance results on the [RAMP challenge](https://github.com/ramp-kits/meg).
